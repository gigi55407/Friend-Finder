# Friend-Finder

The Friend Finder is an app that helps the user find the friend that matches them most closely. The user takes a personality test consisting of 10 true-or-false questions and then clicks Submit. The app then displays the name and picture of the friend whose test answers mostly closely match the user's.

This app was created using Express, Body Parser, Path, javascript, HTML and CSS.
